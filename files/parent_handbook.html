        Dear	Parents	and	Guardians, <br/><br/>
        At	the	Nursery	School	we	strive	to	provide	a	great	learning	environment	for	each	and	every	
        child	in	our	care.	We	recognize	that	a	strong	partnership	with	parents	and	clarity	about	
        expectations	for	how	we	will	work	together	in	this	effort	are	critical.	Please	take	time	to	read	
        through	this	Parent	Handbook	and	to	familiarize	yourself	with	its	content.	It	provides	
        important	information	and	helpful	guidance.	We	ask	parents	to	know	and	follow	the	
        procedures	and	rules	contained	in	this	Handbook.	We	hope	it	will	become	your	go-to	source	for	
        information.	<br/><br/>
        Nikki	Scheele,	Director
      </i></p>
      <p>
        At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	every	child	is	a	unique	individual	
        with	his	or	her	own pattern	and	timetable	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual	and	physical	
        growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        We	believe	in	learning	through	play;	we	provide	fun,	child-centered	activities	that	effectively	
        engage	students.	We	encourage	creativity	in	all	areas	with	a	special	focus	on	the	arts	to	
        enhance	language	and	thinking.	Above	all,	our	goals	are	that	children	will	develop	a	genuine	
        pleasure	in	learning,	that	they	develop	confidence	in	their	ability	to	learn	and	to	accomplish challenging tasks 
        and that they gain experience and skills in interacting with others.
      </p>
      <h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
      <p>
        Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
        catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
        provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
        developmental	areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.
      </p>
      <h1 id="vision">Vision Statement</h1>
      <p>Washington University Nursery School:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Values	children	for	their	wonder	and	curiosity,	their	ideas	and	creativity,	and	their	
          delight	in	play.
        </li>
        <li>
          Values	families	for	their	traditions	and	goals,	their	commitment	to	home,	work,	play,	
          community,	and	their	dreams	for	their	children.
        </li>
        <li>
          Values	teachers	for	their	vision,	their	job	in	children’s	play	and	achievements,	their	
          flexibility	and	skill,	and	their	commitment	and	compassion.		We	support	and	respect	
          what	we	learn	from	each	other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="history">History</h1>
      <p>
        The	Washington	University	Nursery	School	was	founded	in	1947	as	a	cooperative	venture	of	
        faculty	and	Washington	University	in	St.	Louis.	The	primary	purpose	of	the	nursery	school	is	
        to	provide	the	highest	quality	preschool	program	for	children	2	years	and	7	months	to	5	
        years	of	age.	Today	about	70	percent	of	the	children	are	from	families	of	Washington	
        University	in	St.	Louis	faculty,	staff	and	students, and	the	remaining	are	from	families	in	the	
        community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children	come	from	a	variety	of	countries,	cultures	and	economic	backgrounds. The	school	
        maintains	the	high	standards	of	the	National	Association	for	the	Education	of	Young	
        Children,	by	which it is	accredited.	It	is	licensed	by	the	State	of	Missouri.
      </p>
      <p>
        The	nursery	school	also	serves	as	a	site	for	research	in	child	development.	Washington	
        University	undergraduate	and	graduate	students	are	employed	to	assist in	the	classrooms.	
        The	classroom	teachers,	as	well	as	the	nursery	school’s	director,	supervise	them.	The	student	
        workers’	presence	enables	children	to	receive	additional	individual	attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        The	nursery	school	is	located	on	the	Washington	University	campus.	It	is	composed	of	three	
        classrooms, which	are	designed	to	offer	children	a	variety	of	choices	in	their	play.	Two	
        additional	all-purpose	rooms	are	equipped	with	a	library	and	a	variety	of	indoor	gross	motor	
        play	materials. A	large	outdoor	play	area	gives	children	the	opportunity	to	run,	bike,	swing,	
        climb,	slide	and	play	in	the	sand.
      </p>
      <h1 id="staff">Staff</h1>
      <p>
        The	staff	at	the	nursery	school	respects	and	appreciates	the	talents	and	personalities	of	each	
        child	and	his	or	her	family.	A	teacher’s	individual	talents	are	also	encouraged	as	she	or	he	
        develops	his	or	her	own	personal	approach	in	the	classroom.	This	makes	for	a	vibrant,	
        growing	community	of	children,	families	and	teachers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In	general,	teachers	hold	a	Bachelor	or	Master	degree	in	early	childhood or	elementary
        education	and/or	teaching.		All	have	extensive	early	childhood	teaching	experience.
        <a href="/staff.html">Meet our staff here!</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Professional	development	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.		The	school	pays	fees	for	
        workshops	and	conferences	during	the	year.		In	addition,	there	are	two teacher	in-service	
        days	and	monthly	staff	meetings.		All	teachers	are	certified	in CPR	and	First	Aid.
      </p>
      <h1 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h1>
      <p>At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	children	are	unique	individuals	
        with	their	own	patterns	and	timetables	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual,	and	physical	
        development.		We	support	and	encourage	their	development	through	our	child-centered,	
        process-oriented,	play-based	curriculum	built	on	Constructivist	theories	and	practices.		
        Guided	by	the	teachings	of	educational	theorists	including	Piaget,	Dewey,	Vygotsky,	DeVries,	
        and	others,	we	create	a	learning	environment	that	addresses	the	developmental	needs	of	the	
        whole	child	by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Structuring	classroom	experiences	around	ideas	and	topics	that	are	relevant	to	the	
          students,	with	the	understanding	that	knowledge	is	constructed	through	language,	
          discussion,	experimentation,	and	manipulation	of	objects	that	are	meaningful	to	
          them.</li>
        <li>Offering	learning	experiences	that	appeal	to	multiple	senses	and	that	provide	handson	activities	using	materials	that	encourage	exploration,	investigation,	and	learning.</li>
        <li>Allowing	each	child	to	interact	with	the	environment	at	his/her	own	pace,	and	
          creating	opportunities	for	children	to	explore	individually,	with	a	partner,	or	with	a	
          larger	group	of	peers.</li>
        <li>Asking	open-ended	questions,	allowing	students	the	time	to	thoughtfully	form	
          responses,	listening	respectfully	to	their	answers,	and	gently	guiding	them	toward	
          the	answers	they seek	as	they	develop	enhanced	reasoning	skills.</li>
        <li>Respecting	students’	ideas,	encouraging	independent	thinking,	and	empowering	
          students	to	become	problem	solvers.</li>
        <li>Using	the	wonderful	resource	of	our	diverse,	multi-cultural	population	to	highlight	
          the	similarities	and	differences	between	individuals,	families,	and	cultures,	
          celebrating	the	unique	environment	that	is	Washington	University	Nursery	School.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The	Washington	University	Nursery	School’s	open	curriculum	framework	is	presented	to	
        children	in	ways	that	are	developmentally	appropriate	and	based	on	our	philosophy	that	
        children	learn	most	effectively through	play.		Using	a	learning	center	approach,	each	teaching	
        team	offers	experiences	in	art,	writing,	science,	dramatic	play,	blocks,	manipulatives,	and	
        literacy.		Teacher	planning	takes	into	account	the	social,	emotional,	intellectual,	and	physical	
        developmental	needs	of	the	child.</p>
      <h1 id="classroom-info">Classroom Information</h1>
      <p>Our	classes focus	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Each	year’s	class	builds	
        on	the	previous	year’s	program	in	curriculum	experiences	and	activities	offered.	The	
        classrooms	are	set	up	to	invite	exploration	and	foster	a	lifelong	love	of	learning.	Our	staff	is	
        deeply	committed	to	the	young	child	and	the	importance	of	early	childhood	education.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Two's/Young Three's:</strong>	 Children	must	turn	3 by	February	1	of	that	school	year.	The	focus	of	
        this	class	is	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Separating	from	parents,	
        learning	to	take	direction,	and	being	nurtured	by	people	outside	of	immediate	family	are	
        important	milestones	for this	age.	The	building	of	trust	and	growing	peer	awareness	are	
        enhanced	by	a	safe	environment	that	provides	a	foundation	for	learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Three's/Young Four's:</strong> The	emphasis	in	this class	is	to	encourage	further	socialization	by	
        reinforcing	how	a	child’s	choices	affect	their	relationships	and	environment.	There	are	
        greater	expectations	for	participation	and	appropriate	play	practices.	This	class	fosters	
        independence,	creativity,	cognitive	growth,	and	motor	coordination.	Children	are	introduced	
        to	phonemic	awareness,	patterning,	number	sequencing	with	value	recognition	and	
        following	both	verbal	and	visual	directions.	
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Four's/Young Five's:</strong> The	intent	of	this	class	is	to	further	support	the	development	of	social	
        awareness,	emotional	intelligence,	and	Kindergarten	readiness	skills.	Critical	thinking,	
        science,	sequencing,	sorting	and	classification,	matching,	number	values,	phonemic	
        awareness,	problem	solving,	storytelling	and	following	multi-step	directions	are	all	
        incorporated	in	our	curriculum.	Children	develop	their	gross	and	fine	motor	skills	while	
        working	in	large	and	small	groups.	Through	play	and	collaborative	group	work,	children
        come	to	appreciate	the	value	of	cooperation	and	contribution.	The	children	are	encouraged	
        to	take	risks,	helping	them	discover	how	the	process	of	learning	is	often	more	valuable	than	
        the	outcome.	Mastering	appropriate	academic	skills	and	fostering	social	emotional	growth	
        are	the	cornerstones	of	this	program.	
      </p>
      <p><strong>Bear Tracks</strong></p>
      <p>The	Bear	Tracks	program	provides	an	extension	of	classroom	activities	for	children	who	are	
        enrolled	in	the	half-day	program. Children	who	attend	Bear	Tracks	are	ready	for	more	than	
        half-day	classes	but	perhaps	not	full-day	schedules.</p>
      <p>Bear	Tracks is	offered	Tuesday	through	Friday,	9:45	a.m.	– 12:30	p.m.,	for	afternoon	students
        and	Monday	through	Friday,	11:45	a.m.	– 2:30	p.m.,	for	morning	students.	Parents	may	enroll	
        their	children	for	participation	in	Bear	Tracks	for	any	or	all	days	it	is	offered.</p>
      <p>In	addition	to	free	choice,	outdoor	time	and	a	snack,	the	daily	Bear	Tracks	schedule	includes	
        a	special	activity.	These	activities	are	designed	to	engage	a	smaller,	multi-age	group	of	
        children	in	hands-on	learning	in	a	specialized content	area,	such	as	art,	science,	movement	or	
        literacy.	Bear	Trackers,	for	example,	might	take	a	nature hike	one	day,	create	an	art	project	
        the	next, or	dramatize	a	story in	any	particular week.</p>
      <p>The	main	goal	for	the	Bear	Tracks	program	is	to	continue	the	progress	children	are	making	
        in	their	regular	classroom	within	a	varied	and	creative	curriculum.	Children	must	be	
        toilettrained	to	enroll	in	Bear	Tracks.</p>
      <h1 id="communication">Home/School Communication</h1>
      <p><strong>Orientation Day</strong></p>
      <p>
        This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
        opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
        hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
        overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.<br /><br />
        The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
        orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
        Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
        before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Parent-Staff Communication</strong></p>
      <p>Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
        give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
        emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
        concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
        or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.</p>
      <p><strong>Assesment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</strong></p>
      <p>
        Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
        conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
        development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
        writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
        in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	<br/><br/>
        The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
        informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
        more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
        time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.
      </p>
      <h1 id="disclipline">Discipline</h1>
      <p>The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
        for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
        to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
        rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
        safe.	</p>
      <p>The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
        appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
        stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
        the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
        their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
        more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
        lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.</p>
      <p>Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
        children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
        learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done	
        through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Positive reinforcement</li>
        <li>Anticipating unhealthy social interaction</li>
        <li>Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.</li>
        <li>Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings</li>
        <li>Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner.</li>
        <li>Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences.</li>

      <p>When	inappropriate	behavior	is	a	continuing	problem, the	school	will	work	with	parents	to	
        understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations.		It	is	our	goal	to	make	school	
        a	positive,	rewarding	and	enjoyable	experience	for	each	child.		We	realize, however,	that	we	
        cannot	meet	the	needs	of	all	children	and	parents.		If	it	is	determined	that	a	child	is	not	
        growing	from	his/her	preschool	experience	at	the	Nursery	School, a	discussion	will	be	held	
        with	parents	at	which	it	may	be	decided	that	this	program	is	not	appropriate	for	the	child.		
        The	director	and	teachers	will	make	recommendations	of	other	preschool	programs	and	
        relevant	community	services	if	parents	so	desire.</p>
